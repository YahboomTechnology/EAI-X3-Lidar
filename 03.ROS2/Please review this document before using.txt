Before using the radar, you need to install the SDK first!
1. Unzip YDLidar-SDK-master.zip;
2. Enter the YDLidar-SDK-master folder and create a new build folder;
3. Enter the built build folder, open the terminal in this directory, and then run in sequence,
(1), cmake ..
(2), make
(3), sudo make install
4. If there is no error in any step, the installation is successful.
